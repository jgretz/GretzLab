		This is a talk I put together to discuss some of the cool things the Objective-C language can do (such as introspection, swizzling, etc). the ultimate goal was to encourage people to write <a href="https://scotch.io/bar-talk/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design" target="_blank">SOLID</a> code, but it also set the foundation for what I did with my Objective-C IOS framework.<a href="https://github.com/jgretz/CoreMeta" target="_blank">CoreMeta</a>

		I presented this talk at That Conference 2013.
