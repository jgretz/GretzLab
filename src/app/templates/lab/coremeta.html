	<h1>CoreMeta</h1>
	<p>
	CoreMeta is my IOC / DI framework for iOS. With some simple configuration, you get a lot of nice magic that make plumbing code a thing of the past. In addition, your code naturally will be more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)" target="_blank">SOLID</a> and more easily testable.
	</p>
	<p>
	There are some out there who don't objective-c needs an IOC / DI framework. I obviously disagree, and I think this comes from my polygot background. In general, I prefer to write code that is loosely coupled, which leads to a lot of small single objective files. When I first came to objective-c, I was forced to write a lot of code that was just prepping the service object, which in turn, caused the containing class's dependency graph to grow unnecessarily large. If you need an example of this just look at any of apple's example projects - giant app delegates and massive view controllers abound. I just refuse to write code that way. With IOC / DI, code is cleaner, smaller, and more obvious. If you want to see a talk I gave on the subject take a look at <a href="" target="_blank">Objective-C can do WHAT?!?!</a>

	In addition to IOC / DI, CoreMeta also contains:
	<ul>
		<li>An object mapper (similar to .Net's <a href="http://automapper.org/" target="_blank">AutoMapper</a>)</li>
		<li>A promises framework</li>
		<li>A bunch of handy categories</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	CoreMeta came out of my work projects at <a href="http://truefit.io" target="_blank">Truefit</a>. Due to this, there are some rough edges such as: lack of tests, no class name prefixing, and a default universal container. Some of these choices were made for reasons, but this warning is here as a mea culpa. I am trying to get address many of the known issues in the next version.

	CoreMeta is currently written in objective-c. It still will work with Swift (thanks to Daniel Sadi who wrote this <a href="https://danielsaidi.wordpress.com/2014/09/04/my-approach-to-ioc-in-ios/" target="_blank">article</a> on the implementation). I am working on porting it to Swift, cleaning up and upgrading along the way.
