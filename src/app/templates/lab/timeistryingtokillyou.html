	<h1>Time Is Trying To Kill You</h1>
	<p>
		This is a talk I've been putting together for a while. I'll be presenting it at <a href="https://www.thatconference.com/sessions/session/6965">ThatConference 2015</a>.
		<br /><br />
		This talk examines how we view the value of what we do as developers, how we came to be judged by hours, and how we can move to a better place.
