	<h1>Terminator</h1>
	<p>
	Watching Terminator as a child (why shouldn't 8 year olds watch Arnold?) sparked my love of robots. Like most fans, I was fascinated by the idea of autonomous machines becoming a reality. As I grew older, I eventually realized that the real challenge wasn’t building a Terminator but, rather, the network that dictated its decisions.

	For Skynet to make those decisions, it needs data, and LOTS of it. We currently carry in our pockets one of the greatest data collection devices ever created by mankind: our smartphone. The problem, however, lies directly in mankind’s involvement—the human decides what the device sees. That is, until recently. Romotive, a new robot that takes the unique approach of having an iOS device for a brain, solves the issue. As a result, the network can gather input on its own.

	In this session, we’ll build a rudimentary Skynet in an hour. The Romotive SDK enables our robot to move. CoreImage identifies targets and Azure stores the data so it can learn over time. In the end, we will have a moving and thinking robot … ultimately deciding who lives, and who is terminated.
